# Let Me Do It For You: On the Feasibility of Inter-Satellite Friendly Jamming

## Description

This project investigates the feasibility of inter-satellite friendly jamming as a protective measure for LEO satellites against unauthorized ground station transmissions. We propose an orbital Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) capable of simulating real-life scenarios and evaluating the selective jamming capabilities of currently active satellites.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Julian-Rederle/letmedoitforyou
   cd letmedoitforyou
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   See [here](https://help.agi.com/stkdevkit/index.htm#python/pythonGettingStarted.htm)

## Usage

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. Here is a basic example of how to run the simulations:

```bash
cd code

python experiment1.py
python experiment2.py

python visualize_times.py
```

For more sophisticated usage and parameters, refer to the `code/README.md` file.

## Roadmap

Future plans for the project include:
- Conducting practical evaluations with real satellites.
- Expanding the protection model to encompass a comprehensive set of publicly accessible ground stations.
- Exploring the feasibility of the actual antenna requirements for RF hardware on active satellites.
